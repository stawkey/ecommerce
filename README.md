## Getting Started

To get the project up and running on your local machine, follow these setup instructions:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
A MongoDB instance should be running and accessible.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/stawkey/ecommerce.git
    cd ecommerce
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    Navigate to the `backend` folder:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```
    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and configure your environment variables.
    ```env
    PORT=your_backend_port
    MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
    ```
    Start the backend server:
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```

3.  **Frontend Setup:**
    Navigate to the `frontend` folder:
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```
    Start the frontend development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Once both frontend and backend servers are running, you should be able to access the application in your browser (usually at `http://localhost:5173`).
